## Welcome To Oluwatosin's journey💕

Hi, I am Oluwatosin
I am sure you will agree with me that the world we live in has changed from what we knew it to be and literally everyone uses the internet these days, even toddlers on their little tablets. 

Our exposure to cyberattacks and decrease in privacy has increased greatly in recent times and we need people who understand these concepts to help us manage these risks and prevent attacks, that is why i am here🙋🏽‍♀️.

I am studying masters in cybersecurity at the University of Essex Online to help me develop the knowledge and skills crucial to develop and excel in my role of being a cybersecurity analyst. I am technically a newbie, so I am thrilled to start this journey. Through this digital portfolio, a brief demonstration of my skills and and experience.
